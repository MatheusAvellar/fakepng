# Fake PNG generator

Do you hate images that *pretend* to be transparent, but in reality just have a checkerboard background?

Well, now you can make your own! This generator takes an existing, transparent-background image, and adds that awful checkerboard background to it!

Check it out at [lab.avl.la/fakepng](https://lab.avl.la/fakepng/)!
